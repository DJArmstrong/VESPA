vespa
======

``vespa`` is a Python package built to enable automated false positive
probability (FPP) analysis of transiting planet signals (and so much
more!). It implements the latest version of the general procedure
described in detail in `Morton (2012)
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...761....6M>`_, and is being
actively developed on `GitHub
<http://github.com/timothydmorton/vespa>`_.  It also makes use of the
`isochrones <http://isochrones.rtfd.org>`_ package.  Please `raise an
issue <http://github.com/timothydmorton/vespa/issues>`_ with
any questions or comments you may have about this code.

.. note::

   For some reason, the API links in this documentation mysteriously
   stopped working (both on readthedocs and when I build on my local
   machine, except for two submodules deep inside this
   package--treasure hunt!).  So first, apologies for the
   inconvenience, and second, if you have any idea why, or just want
   to make some noise about this issue, please `chime in
   <https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/1803>`_.
