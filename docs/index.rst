vespa
=================================

``vespa`` is a Python package built to enable automated false positive
probability (FPP) analysis of transiting planet signals. It implements
the latest version of the general procedure described in detail in
`Morton (2012) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...761....6M>`_,
and is being actively developed on `GitHub
<http://github.com/timothydmorton/vespa>`_.  It also makes use of the
`isochrones <http://isochrones.rtfd.org>`_ package.
